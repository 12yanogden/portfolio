The sprint was already behind schedule, and the pressure to deliver was mounting. I had just been reassigned to help fix a critical feature, stepping into a situation I barely understood. As I dug into the code, I quickly realized that the core functionality wasn’t just incomplete — it was deeply flawed.

The feature lead, however, had a different perspective. Whenever I flagged an issue, their response was the same: blame another developer. A broken component? “That’s on them.” Misaligned functionality? “They were supposed to handle that.” The pattern was consistent, and so was the underlying problem: the lead was unaware of the real scope of the issues, many of which had slipped through their own code reviews.

Despite the dysfunction, we delivered the feature on time. Yet the experience left an impression that went far beyond the sprint itself. It taught me a fundamental lesson about leadership: **when you lead, the successes belong to your team, but the failures belong to you**.

In this article, I’ll explore how accountability defines strong leadership, the pitfalls of blame culture, and practical steps leaders can take to foster trust, collaboration, and resilience within their teams.

## The Importance of Accountability in Leadership

Leadership accountability isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a cornerstone of effective teamwork. When a leader deflects blame, it fractures trust, damages their credibility, and diverts attention from the underlying syndromatic issues at play.

In my anecdote above, the feature lead chose to ignore critical issues rather than addressing those issues proactively. Now, imagine if blame-shifting became rampant on the team. Collaboration would stagnate as developers hid mistakes and questions, for fear of being vulnerable to criticism. The cycle of finger pointing would spiral into a toxic environment, undermining talent retention, development velocity, and product quality _all at the same time_.

By contrast, proactive accountability creates the opposite effect. When leaders take ownership of outcomes, they build trust and encourage collaboration. Once developers feel free from blame, they will take risks, make mistakes, and ask questions. They will drive a virtuous cycle of innovation for which employees stay, development velocity accelerates, and product quality achieves new levels of excellence.

## 10 Ways to Avoid Shifting Your Responsibility to Developers

1. **Complete the Planning Phase**
   Unclear requirements or poorly defined tickets at the start of a sprint are classic examples of a leader shifting their responsibility onto developers. Effective leadership means providing developers with more than a vague sentence and a screenshot — clear, actionable guidance is essential for success.

2. **Watch Ticket Assignments**
   Occasionally, a junior developer may take on a ticket that exceeds their current skill level. When the timeline doesn’t allow for a learning curve, it becomes the leader's responsibility to proactively reassign the ticket. Waiting until the project is behind schedule is not an option.

3. **Remove Developers Who Do Not Contribute**
   Retaining unskilled developers out of reluctance to remove them is a dereliction of leadership responsibility. Your team should consist only of individuals who can be trusted to reliably contribute.

4. **Code Review Effectively**
   In my anecdote above, the feature lead was blaming developers for code that he had reviewed and merged. Mediocre code reviews puts responsibility soley on the developers to evaluate code quality, instead of sharing that responsiblity together.

5. **Check in Often**
   While developers can be encouraged to reach out with questions, the reality is that some may hesitate — whether out of embarrassment, pride, or both. As a leader, it’s your responsibility to create opportunities for open dialogue, not just theirs. Make it a point to check in with each developer at least once a day. Standup meetings do not suffice. Create a private, judgment-free setting where developers feel comfortable admitting challenges and seeking clarity without fear of criticism.

6. **Train Developers**
   Although developers are expected to constantly improve their skills, it's the leader's responsibility too. Teach them what you know. In my experience, developers are incredibly receptive.

7. **Keep a Wholeistic Perspective**
   Every once in awhile a developer will really let you down. Instead of using them as a scapegoat, consider everything else that went wrong. Were expectations clear? Did they have the tools, time, and guidance needed to succeed? Doing so might help identify systematic issues to address.

8. **Provide Feedback Often**
   A leader's silence is quickly filled by a developer's own self-doubts or agrandized ego. Do not let developers assume what you think. Take a moment to apologize for their challenges, ask them to change, or thank them for a job well done.

9. **Praise Publically and Often**
   When I see a developer do something exceptional, I write it down on my "Trophy Wall". That way, I have a prepared list of praiseworthy items to bring up during standups, retrospectives, performance reviews, and recommendation letters.

10. **The Buck Stops Here**
    If the code is falling apart, it's primarily the leader's responsibility. Maybe a developer really messed up, but the leader is never free of blame. Success begins and ends with them.
